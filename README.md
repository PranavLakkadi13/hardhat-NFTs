3 contracts:-

1. Basic NFT ✅

2. Random IPFS NFT -> Random at creation time making them rare and be hosted on IPFS ✅
--> Pros: It is cheap
--> Cons: Someone at all times have to pin the ipfs file 

3. Dynamic SVG NFT -> Hosted completely onchain, But when somechanges are made to the parameters it alter the image onChain 
--> Pros: Hosted completely onchain
--> Cons: Much more Expensive
